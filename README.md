## üè¢ Business Problem  
Pizza House management lacked a clear understanding of:
- Which pizza types and sizes generate the most revenue and orders.  
- How sales fluctuate across days and months.  
- Which products underperform and require marketing or menu adjustments.

The absence of a unified dashboard made it difficult to track KPIs such as total revenue, order volume, and customer demand trends‚Äîlimiting data-driven decision-making.
